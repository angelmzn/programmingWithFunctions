What does our project do?

We want to create a small website that allows us to enter the name of a pokemon and returns that pokemon's information, picture, description, stats, etc. 

Steps:

step 1: Declare a function to  fetch the information we need from the API, returns it and assign it to a variable.
step 2: Declare another function that will create the elements required to view the result, an h3, img, div, p, etc. 
step 3: Assign each element to display their respective content.
